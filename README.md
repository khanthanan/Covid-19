Ranking Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions against Covid-19 Global Pandemic using Global Sensitivity Analysis - Effect on Number of Deaths

Here, we provide Matlab files to verify estimated parameter values. Please refer to the manuscript entitled "Ranking Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions against Covid-19 Global Pandemic using Global Sensitivity Analysis - Effect on Number of Deaths" for more details on the mathematical model derivations and equations. The Matlab file 'ParameterEstimatationVerification.m' will compare our mathematical model results with the daily reported and cumulative deaths in United States from March 1, 2020, to November 26, 2020. SEIR12EqnCalc.m Matlab function provides the implementation of the mathematical model. Please note the implementation of time-dependent transmission coefficient in line 56-70. We also include a Matlab function (plotBeta.m) to plot the time-dependent transmission coefficient.
